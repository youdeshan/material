The laptop which has both nvidia card and integrated vidio card will have great
noise. So it is necessary to switch between these two cards to avoid noise.

1. identify your NVIDIA graphics hardware, run the following command:
   lspci -k | grep -EA2 'VGA|3D'

   actually, you will see the nvidia card and integrated card are both enabled.

2. check which driver version support your nvidia adapter

3. install the latest driver version which supports your nvidia adapter(eg:
        GeForce 310M)
   sudo apt-get install nvidia-340

   actually, the prime-select package will be installed automatically

4. switch to integrated card
   sudo prime-select intel

5. reboot

Futhermore, you can run the following command to reduce the hard disk acoustic:
   sudo hdparm -M128 /dev/sda
